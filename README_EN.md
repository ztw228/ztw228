# ðŸŒŸ Hello! I'm HÃ©loÃ¯se!

## About Me
I'm currently a senior student majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Tamkang University. I have a strong interest in AI and cybersecurity, especially in the following areas:

- ðŸŽ¯ Cybersecurity
- ðŸŒˆ Computer Vision & Image Processing
- ðŸ’¬ Natural Language Processing
- ðŸ”Ž Deep Learning

## Featured Projects
- **Analyzing Web Server Attacks Using Bi-LSTM - A Case Study of Nginx Server Logs**: Leveraged a Bi-LSTM model to analyze Nginx server logs and detect web attacks.
- **Tamkang General Course Selection System**: Automated course selection by using OpenCVâ€™s binarization, Gaussian noise reduction, Tesserocr for captcha recognition, and Webdriver to fill out Tamkang Universityâ€™s course selection form.
- **Third-person RPG Game**: Developed an RPG game using Unityâ€™s Navigation, Animation, and Blend Tree techniques for action and environment, integrated with Mixamo for character design.
- **Convolutional Neural Network Quantization**: Explored 4-bit linear quantization in CNNs, comparing pre- and post-quantization performances and the pros and cons of linear and cluster-based quantization. Found that quantization significantly reduces memory usage and accelerates computations.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Researched knowledge distillation, observing that a student model trained via distillation captures more compact features than the teacher model, resulting in higher accuracy.
- **Neural Network Backpropagation Experiment**: Implemented a neural network from scratch to demonstrate the backpropagation algorithm, showing how the network learns from initial random weights to improve accuracy through backpropagation.
- **Language Model Experiment**: Built a Bayesâ€™ Theorem-based model from scratch, generating novel text. Found that the number of input layers affected both the completeness of the information and the coherence of the generated text.
- **Generative AI Experiment**: Used cGANs to generate new images by combining multiple inputs. The experiment successfully generated images recognizable by Google Image Search as dog breeds.
- **Genetic Algorithm - Mario Game**: Applied genetic algorithms to play through levels of a Mario game, observing how fitness selection improved the algorithm's efficiency in developing better strategies.
